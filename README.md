# Project 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation

## Goal
Clean a Raw Dataset by Handling missing values, Inconsistencies,
Duplicates, and Incorrect data type Format.

## Key Requirements
- Identify missing or null values
- Remove duplicates
- Correct data formats (dates, numbers, text)
- Trimmed the dataset
- Capitalized the categoryical data with Proper Case.

## Step by Step Data Cleaning
- Before I started cleaning the data, I looked through the dataset to understand what the dataset is all about, in the course of looking through the dataset, I saw some missing values, inconsistencies in some columns and inappropriate data type format. 
- I clean to ensure absolute accuracy in the dataset.
  
## Here is a breakdown of my data cleaning process:
- Handled Missing & Duplicate Data: No duplicate values were found in the Order ID while missing values in columns like Coupon codes column was replaced with "No Coupon" Because the missing values were over 20% values of the dataset.
- Standardized Format: AlL the inconsistencies in the Categorical columns were capitalized and trimmed.
- Number Formnats: I Changed all the columns into their proper data type format.
- Changed the Total price and Unit Price to Currency ($) to 2 decimal places for accurate trend analysis.
